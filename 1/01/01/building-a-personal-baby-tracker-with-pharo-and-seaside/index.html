    <p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve discovered about parenting is that
babies are tracked religously. How much are they sleeping? Are they
eating enough? Did they pee/poop the correct number of times in the
last 24 hours? This isn&rsquo;t just frettful new parent stuff (although
it totally is that too) but things that pediatricians want to know
and could be the early signs of problems when there isn&rsquo;t a good
way to know if there is a problem. There are many apps that will
help with this giving simple GUI to measure all sorts of things.
<a href="https://babytracker.info/">Here</a> is a website that compares some,
and a quick search of the App Store will give many more. The problem
I have with all of these solutions is that you are minutely tracking
the first stages of your childs life and development and giving all
that data to someone else. The people who make these apps are running
a business and you&rsquo;re the product. Now I don&rsquo;t necessarily have an
issue with that, I&rsquo;m using multiple apps that work by targeting ads
to me. I get it but I didn&rsquo;t want to feed the personal data mining
machine. I didn&rsquo;t want to read a privacy policy or even worry about
it, I wanted something where there was no data to be given away and
sold. So I wrote my own personal baby tracker.</p>
<p>The requirements were pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dead easy UI so even in a sleep deprived state we could log updates.</li>
<li>Available across multiple devices.</li>
<li>Only accessible to people caring for our newborn.</li>
<li>Easy development and deployment. This is a personal project so it doesn&rsquo;t need to scale.</li>
<li>Have some fun.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instead I wrote an MVP that works for me.</li>
<li>Used Seaside framework with <a href="https://pharo.org">Pharo</a> 10 because I wanted to try it out.</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/">MVP css</a> for basic styling.</li>
<li>Was really impressed with how easy Seaside was to generate pages. No need to learn a templating language like in Python or Ruby. Instead write the HTML structure using smalltalk code.</li>
<li>Pharo&rsquo;s refactoring tools were really useful for extracting logic into separate methods when things were getting too long.</li>
<li>Seaside doesn&rsquo;t provide any persistence like Django or Ruby on Rails. In that regard it&rsquo;s a bit more like Flask. Pharo has many libraries for persistence</li>
<li>I chose <a href="https://github.com/rko281/ReStoreForPharo">ReStore</a> as it looked easy to set up. And it was!</li>
<li>ReStore has a simple way to add translations for Smalltalk messages into SQL functions or expressions. I was able to add in sqlite3&rsquo;s <code>unixepoch</code> function by using the <code>asUnixTime</code> message that is understood by the <code>DateAndTime</code></li>
</ul>
