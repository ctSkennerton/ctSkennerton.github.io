    <p><a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a> is a modal editor in the same vein as Vim which means that there are different &ldquo;modes&rdquo; where
the same key strokes mean different things. The main benefit for a modal editor is that many complex
actions can be handled with just the keyboard rather than using the mouse or menus.
I&rsquo;ve been a Vim user for over a decade so I was interested to see what a modal editor that doesn&rsquo;t
come from that lineage would look like. My motivation was the complexity of getting my Neovim
config set up just right when working with language servers and tree-sitter. Helix had these
features built in so I wanted to see if Helix could improve my productivity without having to
mess around with a lot of plugins.</p>
<p>I installed helix using homebrew as recommended (<kbd>brew install helix</kbd>). Initally I was confused
about the command I needed to run. Turns out that it isn&rsquo;t Helix but <code>hx</code>. The documentation
directed me to use the tutorial with <code>hx --tutor</code> and I&rsquo;m glad I did as it presented the editing
commands in a logical and easy way. I did want to skip ahead at some points as I was familiar with
and there are many similarities but as you get further through the differences show up. You&rsquo;ll want to
keep a link to the <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html">keymap</a> handy.
The are basic similarities in the key bindings but in helix the grammar is often reversed.
For example, instead of typing <kbd>dw</kbd> you would type <kbd>wd</kbd>. This small change is really interesting
as you can see what you are selecting (and potentially modify it) before doing anything
destructive. It&rsquo;s sort of like having Vim visual mode always being on.
Comands that normally move the cursor in vim will change the selection in helix. So, <kbd>w</kbd>
won&rsquo;t just move to the end of the word but instead select the whole word. For basic incantations
like <kbd>dw</kbd> (in Vim) or <kbd>wd</kbd> (in Helix) this will have the same effect - the word will be deleted.</p>
<p>The muscle memory from Vim to Helix can be tough. In particular, I&rsquo;m fond of typing <kbd>x</kbd> to delete
a single character and <kbd>gg</kbd> (or <kbd>G</kbd>) to move to parts of the current file. Having these be different
things in Helix took some getting used to. But not in a bad way. I enjoy Helix take on <code>g</code> command
to let me move to all parts of the line or file. The mnemonic for <code>g</code> being &ldquo;go&rdquo; in Helix versus &ldquo;global&rdquo;
in Vim seems more natural to me.
I do miss marks though. A very common workflow for me was setting locations in Vim using <kbd>ma</kbd> or <kbd>mb</kbd>
to jump around a buffer. In Helix, <code>m</code> is for entering &ldquo;match mode&rdquo; that lets you select different parts
of the buffer. It&rsquo;s very useful just hard to break habits. There currently isn&rsquo;t an equivelent to vim&rsquo;s
marks in helix. Instead you can save locations in a jump list using <kbd>Crtl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> and then returning
to those locations using <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> and choosing them from a pop up dialog. It&rsquo;s certainly not
as fast so I hope the helix developers consider having named marks in the future.</p>
<p>The other issue I ran into was the default python configuration requires <code>pylsp</code> which doesn&rsquo;t
work well with my setup that uses <code>pyenv</code>.
Because I use per-project python environments but <code>pyenv</code> creates a shim in my path which Helix
picks up and uses. The language server command needs to be in your path and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out
how to get it to work without installing <code>pylsp</code> into all of my environments. I ended up using
<code>pywright</code> which I installed globally through <code>npm</code>. It&rsquo;s not the cleanest solution but it works.</p>
