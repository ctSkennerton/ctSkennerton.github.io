    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The question that most people ask when looking at a metagenomic draft genome bin
is: should this gene really be there? The answer is that sometimes it&rsquo;s not easy to know</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I spend a lot of my time looking at genome assemblies. They are almost always
from metagenomic data and usually are from some novel phylogenetic lineage
with few (if any) &ldquo;close&rdquo; relatives. Unfortunately the quality of genome
assemblies is such that all of these genomes are in many pieces and due to the
nature of binning, there is always the spectre of some genes not belonging to
the genome that your analyzing. I&rsquo;m currently a middle author on a
<a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/554/">paper</a> that attempts to quantify genome
completeness and contamination using single copy marker genes. The idea is that
there are genes that are always found in a single copy per genome, therefore
if you find them in multiple copies then you&rsquo;ve got some contamination from
other sources. This is great in principle but the number of single-copy genes
is going to be very small for a large set of genomes, for example there are
about 100 of these genes that are common for all bacteria. Assuming that some
bacterial genome has approximately 3000 genes, then looking at only 100 of them
is about 3% of the gene content. That&rsquo;s quite a small percentage to be making
big statements on how good or bad a genome is.</p>

<p>So here is a question that one of my colleagues posed in a group meeting: if a genome has 10%
contamination does that mean that 1 in 10 genes shouldn&rsquo;t be there?</p>

<p>My answer is: of course not, it means that 1 in 10 of the marker genes are in
multiple copies. But it does get me thinking, how can we tell that 10% of all
genes in the genome aren&rsquo;t from contamination?</p>

<p>One of the observations with
single-copy marker genes is that many of them are
co-located such that getting one erroneous contig can disproportionatly increase
contamination. Similarly all of the genes of a contig are either correctly or
incorrectly binned, rather than every 10th gene in some contig being from a
different genome. If we were to assume a perfect situation where every contaminating
contig contained at least one marker gene then the real value of contamination would be
the total number of genes on those contaminating contigs divided by the total number
of genes in the genome bin. The &ldquo;real&rdquo; contamination percent then becomes more
about the size of the contigs rather than the number of marker genes. This is
easy in theory but hard to determine in practice since you need to know which
copy of the marker gene is the contaminant and which is legit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to remove
contigs with extra marker genes to lower the contamination numbers but what about
short contigs that contain no markers? I don&rsquo;t think there is a perfect way
to tell if they belong to a genome or not but one approach has been to look for
paired reads that link these contigs to larger ones in the assembly even if they
are not contiguous. Here again there are questions raised, if there are reads that
link the contig to the bigger assembly why is it separate, why hasn&rsquo;t the assembler
joined the contigs together? The magic behind genome assemblers creates many
interesting outcomes that I can never explain and as such there is no general rule
for believing paired-end links or not. Honestly, I usually go with my gut
(very unscientific) and generally only bother to go further in depth if there are
genes that are important to the story I&rsquo;m trying to write.</p>

<p>The golden rule of interpreting genome bin assemblies is that
the bigger the contig the more confident that you become in assigning
them to a draft genome.
(Of course the answer is just getting a better assembly :P).</p>

<p>With these observations and caveats in mind, what value is there in placing a
percent completeness or contamination based on marker genes if it doesn&rsquo;t really
relate to the total gene content?</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of value but not when the numbers are taken literally.
Marker genes are an approximation and
a way of sorting genomes that are worth a closer look. From experience I can
tell you that a genome that is
&ldquo;90% complete, 5% contamination&rdquo; looks a lot better than one that is
&ldquo;50% complete, 30% contamination&rdquo;. I take these numbers to be a relative score
along with other factors like the total number of contigs (less is better) and the
total number of bases (does it look like it&rsquo;s about the size of a whole genome)
to point me in the right direction of what I should work on first.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every PhD student can contribute to open science by uploading their thesis
literature review onto Wikipedia!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My thesis was entitled &ldquo;Phage-host evolution in a model ecosystem&rdquo;, where I
tracked the evolution of phage genome evolution and the evolution of bacterial
defense mechanisms using metagenomics. When I was writing my thesis I spent a
lot of time writing up the section on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPRs</a>, which are a type of bacterial
adaptive immune system. The CRISPR field has exploded in recent times due to its
applications for genome editing which has also meant that there have been
numerous great reviews on the ever expanding primary literature. Despite this
though I found the CRISPR page on wikipedia to be a bit bare (of course now that
I&rsquo;ve updated it things look better, but check out the edit history for a look at
what I&rsquo;ve added). Since there was already a saturation of reviews on the subject
I decided to go through and add in what I had written for my thesis to
wikipedia. By far the most important <strong>and difficult</strong> part of this is was
formatting the references right. So I made a simple workflow for getting what I
wanted out of my thesis and into wikipedia.</p>

<ol>
<li>First thing, I wrote my thesis in word and used endnote to format my
references using the style from nucleic acids research (which is a numbered
style). If you want to use my method you need to have the exact formatting
style</li>
<li>Export the literature review from word as plain text and then removed
all the parts that aren&rsquo;t needed</li>
<li>Put back in some formatting for the headers using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet">wikipedia&rsquo;s markup</a></li>
<li>Split out the bibliography into a separate file</li>
<li>Then use some very dodgy <a href="http://github.com/ctSkennerton/wikipedia_reference_formatter">perl code</a>
I wrote to format all of the in text citations into the format that wikipedia
requires</li>
</ol>


<p>This perl code takes the text and looks for numbers, or lists of numbers inside
parentheses. For example: (1,2,5), (1-7,14), (1). Then looks up what those
references are in the bibliography, extracting the title of the journal article.
Then it looks up what the pubmed ID is for that paper using
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/">entrezdirect</a> with the title as
the search term. After getting the pubmed IDs for all the cited references it
saves them to a file, so that it can be used later on (without looking up the
pubmed IDs again) and any errors can be fixed manually. Finally all of those in
text citations are replaced with the proper wikipedia markup and your ready to
upload.</p>

<p>There are so many scientific wikipedia pages that are way too brief for their
subject matter and I&rsquo;m not just talking about the thousands of stubs for
bacterial and archaeal species either. My current work is with methane seep
sediment communities that perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_oxidation_of_methane">anaerobic oxidation of
methane</a> (AOM),
the wikipedia page contains five paragraphs. Looking at the broader topic of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenesis">methanogenesis</a> there is still
only three short paragraphs on the biochemistry. We know so much more than this,
all that knowledge fills the pages of hundreds of review articles yet when
someone, anyone types anything into google the first match that comes up is
wikipedia. We should make it better cause it&rsquo;s ultimately the most visible
publication on the internet.</p>

    <link href="http://ctSkennerton.github.io/blog/2014/06/23/My-first-useful-script/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-23T02:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ctSkennerton.github.io/blog/2014/06/23/My-first-useful-script</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Can you remember the first useful thing that you ever coded? I sure can, and I&rsquo;m
thankful for it every day.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve recently finished writing a little program called <a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/fxtract"><code>fxtract</code></a>
(which I&rsquo;ve blogged about <a href="/blog/2013/10/28/testing-out-seqans-multipattern-search-implementations/">before</a>)
that acts like grep but returns whole fasta or fastq records from a file. It&rsquo;s
taken me a very long time to write this thing, primarily cause I&rsquo;m writing it
in C++ but now that it&rsquo;s pretty much done I&rsquo;m feeling nostalgic about why I&rsquo;m
writing it in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in 2010 I was just starting my PhD with <a href="http://www.ecogenomic.org/users/gene-tyson">Gene Tyson</a>
and learning some bioinformatics on a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; dataset (which became my first
<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020095">paper</a>)
that was a huge 10 Mbp of viral sequence data! At the time I was learning Perl
using this great <a href="http://www.woolfit.net/perl/classindex.html">online tutorial</a>
but I found that I needed some more &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; examples to really get to grips
with the language. I can&rsquo;t fully remember what I was doing but I had a tabular
blast output file and I wanted to get the sequence of some contigs with blast
hits. I jumped at the opportunity to solve this with my nasent coding skills and
so I started writing my first useful bit of code:
<a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/scriptShed/blob/master/contig_extractor.pl"><code>contig_extractor.pl</code></a>.</p>

<p>In the beginning it did only what I first wrote it to do: take a blast file and
a fasta file and return some contigs. Over time though it morphed into something
more general &ndash; a way of getting some subset of a fasta file using a list of
identifiers. Over the years I added functionality for different file formats and
allowed searching using regular expressions.
This one piece of code eventually disseminated throughout the whole lab group
as new people came in and needed to solve the same problems. I think that the
introduction to github for many of the PhD students who came after me
was downloading my random collection of scripts just so they
could get their hands on <code>contig_extractor.pl</code>.</p>

<p>Of course every bioinformatician has probably written the same piece of code
to solve the same problem. If I had been smart enough to look I&rsquo;m sure
that I would have found one, but using a script doesn&rsquo;t quite give the same
level of satisfaction as writing it yourself (and finding that it&rsquo;s useful by all your
colleages).</p>

<p>There came a time though when <code>contig_extractor.pl</code> reached it&rsquo;s limit. I was
trying to extract a few thousand records from a fastq file with 100 million and
Perl just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it anymore. And so <code>fxtract</code> was born to do all the good
things from <code>contig_extractor.pl</code> just a heap faster.The sun is setting on my
first useful piece of code, at the moment only my finger memory and force of habit
keeps it being used. But when I think about it, it&rsquo;s been an amazing four year run for something that I
probably thought was going to be a one-off script, hopefully <code>fxtract</code> can get
as much love from me as well.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>rRNA operons are typically poorly assembled in metagenomic datasets due to
highly conserved sequences.  More targeted assembly approaches may be necessary
to obtain accurate reconstructions from short read datasets. There are a few
ways in which we can extract reads originating from either 16S or 18S reads and
there are a number of programs (<a href="http://selab.janelia.org/software/ssu-align/">SSU-ALIGN</a>,
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887657">rRNASelector</a>,
<a href="http://ribopicker.sourceforge.net/">riboPicker</a>,
<a href="http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/RNA/sortmerna/">SortMeRNA</a>,
blast, <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">bowtie</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">bwa</a>) to name a few.</p>

<p>There are a other ways of looking at the communty from raw metagenomic
reads. These are mostly kmer-based approaches like
<a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/">kraken</a> or extended marker gene
approaches like
<a href="http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan">MetaPhlAn</a> or
<a href="http://phylosift.wordpress.com/">phylosift</a>. I&rsquo;m not against any of
them, just never used them, so I&rsquo;m going to keep the following post
specific to 16s/18s community composition</p>

<h2>Extracting 16S/18S reads</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used SortMeRNA and bowtie/bwa in my workflows with good success. The
difference between these two methods is that SortMeRNA that uses a kmer
searching method using an index created from a database of previously sequenced
genes whereas bowtie/bwa use a local alignment method to compare the query sequence to
a previously made database. Below are instructions on how to use both methods.</p>

<h2>Installing and using SortMeRNA</h2>

<p>From the source page for SortMeRNA on <a href="https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna">github</a>
copy the ssh clone url and then open up a terminal window and type
<code>bash
$ git clone git@github.com:biocore/sortmerna.git
$ cd sortmerna
$ ./configure --prefix=$PWD
$ make install
</code>
<strong>Mac OSX install note:</strong> I found that there was an error with my install
with <code>configure</code> complaining that it was missing <code>install-sh</code>. I solved this by
copying <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/buildconf/">autogen.sh</a> into the same
directory as <code>configure</code>, execute it and then try running configure again.</p>

<p>The commands above should install SortMeRNA in the directory which you downloaded
it to.</p>

<h4>Building indexes for SortMeRNA</h4>

<p>SortMeRNA comes packaged with 8 different rRNA databases, all derived from SILVA.
Build either the 16S or 18S database, depending on what you want. Below is the
command used to generate the 18S index (assuming that you&rsquo;ve installed in the
download directory)
<code>bash
$ bin/indexdb_rna --ref rRNA_databases/silva-euk-18s-database-id95.fasta,index/silva-euk-18s-database-id95 --sensitive
</code>
If you <code>ls</code> the index directory you should see four files generated.</p>

<h4>Preprocessing reads</h4>

<p>Now we can use this index to extract the reads that may come from 18S using the
<code>sortmerna</code> command. I&rsquo;m going to assume that there are files containing raw
reads from an Illumina run called <code>file_R1.fastq.gz</code> and <code>file_R2.fastq.gz</code>.
Unfortunately one of the limitations of SortMeRNA is that it requires that you
only give it a single file and that the file is uncompressed. So to start with,
unzip the files using <code>gzip</code> and then combine them into a single file using
<code>merge-paired-reads.sh</code> found in the scripts directory of the SortMeRNA source
code
<code>bash
$ gunzip file_R1.fastq.gz file_R2.fastq.gz
$ bash scripts/merge-paired-reads.sh file_R1.fastq file_R2.fastq combined.fastq
</code>
To save space, it&rsquo;s probably best to re-zip the files to save on harddrive space
<code>bash
$ gzip file_R1.fastq file_R2.fastq
</code></p>

<h4>Extracting the reads</h4>

<p>Now we can run <code>sortmerna</code>, saving matched reads (and their mates) to a file
with the prefix &lsquo;matched-18S&rsquo; in fastq format using 4 processors.
```bash
$ bin/sortmerna &mdash;reads combined.fastq \</p>

<pre><code>--ref rRNA_databases/silva-euk-18s-database-id95.fasta,index/silva-euk-18s-database-id95 \
--paired-in \
--fastx \
--aligned matched-18S \
-a 4
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Installing and using BWA</h2>

<p>My personal preference is to use bwa over bowtie but the merits of either are
debatable (there are also 50 other programs out there that try to solve the same
problem so the choice is yours). Download bwa from <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">github</a>
by copying the ssh clone url and typing the following into the terminal. (Change
directories out of the SortMeRNA source directory before you do this)
<code>bash
$ git clone git@github.com:lh3/bwa.git
$ cd bwa
$ make
</code>
bwa also requires that an index of the database be made. For simplicity, lets
use the same database that was included in SortMeRNA. To make the bwa index
copy the files that you want from the SortMeRNA source directory into a new
location.
<code>bash
$ cp ../sortmerna/rRNA_databases/silva-euk-18s-database-id95.fasta .
$ bwa index silva-euk-18s-database-id95.fasta
</code>
This should make a whole bunch of files that have extra file extensions appended
to the fasta file. With the index created we can now align the reads
<code>bash
$ bwa mem silva-euk-18s-database-id95.fasta file_R1.fastq.gz file_R2.fastq.gz &gt; aligned_18S.sam
</code>
(Notice that there is no preprocessing steps necessary for the reads)</p>

<h4>Postprocessing the sam file</h4>

<p>The output of bwa is a standardized format called <a href="http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf">sam</a>
which many programs will now output. This format essentially describes the
alignment of each of the query sequences to the reference sequences. This is
not exactly what we want, which is the reads that were successful hits to the
reference in fasta/q format. To go from a sam file to a fasta/q file is a little
complicated (I wish it wasn&rsquo;t). To start with, download <a href="https://github.com/samtools/samtools">samtools</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/fxtract">fxtract</a> from github, and download
them into new source directories (bonus points for getting them installed without
a walkthrough). First convert the sam file into its equivalent binary format and
filter out unaligned sequences:
<code>bash
$ samtools view -SubF 4 aligned_18S.sam | samtools sort - aligned_18S &amp;&amp; samtools index aligned_18S.bam
</code>
Now get the names of all the reads that aligned:
<code>bash
$ samtools view aligned_18S.bam | cut -f 1 &gt;aligned_reads.txt
</code>
And finally extract those reads from the original fastq files:
<code>bash
$ fxtract -Hf aligned_reads.txt file_R1.fastq.gz file_R2.fastq.gz &gt;aligned_reads.fastq
</code></p>

Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/fagrep">here</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;m quite interested in string searching algorithms as I&rsquo;ve written a
program, <a href="http://ctskennerton.github.io/crass">crass</a>, which uses a few of them
to search for CRISPR elements.  Crass is pretty fast, but I want it to be faster,
specifically there is one point in crass where it searches for exact matches to many
thousands of patterns.
In a <a href="/blog/2013/10/28/testing-out-seqans-multipattern-search-implementations/">previous post</a>
I tried out a number of different &lsquo;multi-pattern matchers&rsquo; from <a href="http://seqan.de">seqan</a>
and was fairly unimpressed with their speed.  In this testing though I did not try
out the most widely used implementations of multi-pattern matching: GNU grep (using <code>-Ff</code> options).  I don&rsquo;t have any graphs to show, but it was faster, like <strong>a lot</strong> faster.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fair fight though, as grep works very differently to my test program
fxtract.  There is a great mailing list <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2010-August/019310.html">post</a>
by one of the original grep authors on ways to speed things up.  It basically
comes down to I/O (not that the search algorithms aren&rsquo;t highly optimised themselves),
fast input from a file and not copying the data in memory is the key.  Grep doesn&rsquo;t
try to parse the file instead it just loads it into a big buffer in memory and searches
the whole thing, if it finds a match then it figures out the boundaries of the line
the match is on and prints it out.  This is in contrast to programs like fxtract or
crass that parse the file first to get the individual portions of each record before
the search is performed.</p>

<p>This got me thinking that I could drastically speed crass up if I switched over
to the grep way of processing files.  I was a little worried though that determining
the boundaries of a fasta/fastq record from an anonymous buffer might be a bit tricky
so before I modified crass I chose to modify grep so that it would output
fasta or fastq records.</p>

<p>The printing functions in grep live in <code>main.c</code> and start with the function <code>grep</code>, which
in-turn calls <code>grepbuf</code>, which in-turn calls <code>prtext</code> etc.  The code is surprisingly simple,
<code>grep</code> reads from the file and fills a buffer; <code>grepbuf</code> executes
one of the search functions on that buffer; if a match is found, a pointer to the first
character in the line the match was found is returned; and then the printing functions
take over.  The printing functions get a pointer to the start of the line and the end
of the line of the match and pass that through to <code>fwrite</code>.  Everything is handled using
pointer arithmetic for determining the start and end of where to print.</p>

<p>This is great since it&rsquo;s easy to change the pointer to the beginning a end of a record, rather
than a line.  So that just left the logic for me to write in to find the limits of
a record.  Below is a code snippet from grep where I&rsquo;ve added in the logic.  Fasta is
easy to implement as the <code>&gt;</code> symbol is generally unique.  Fastq on the other hand takes
a bit more work, since the <code>@</code> symbol can also be found in the quality string.</p>

<p>```c
char const <em>b = p + match_offset;  /</em>pointer to beginning of matching line<em>/
char const </em>endp = b + match_size; /<em>pointer to end of matching line</em>/
/<em> Avoid matching the empty line at the end of the buffer. </em>/
if (b == lim)
  break;
if(fasta_input)
  {</p>

<pre><code>/*find the beginning of the record*/
while(b &gt; p &amp;&amp; b[0] != '&gt;') --b;
/*find the end of the record*/
while(endp &lt; lim &amp;&amp; endp[0] != '&gt;') ++endp;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
if(fastq_input)
  {</p>

<pre><code>/*find the beginning of the record*/
while(b &gt;= beg)
  { 
    if(b[0] == '@')
      {
        if(b - 2 &lt;= beg)
          /*can't go back any further therefore must be start of record*/
          break;

        if (b[-1] == '\n' &amp;&amp; b[-2] != '+')
          /*@ symbol at beginning of line but not the first in the quality */
          break;
      }
  --b;
}
endp = b;
int newline_count;
for(newline_count = 0; newline_count &lt;4; ++newline_count)
  {
    /*find the end of the record*/
    while(endp &lt; lim &amp;&amp; endp[0] != '\n') 
      ++endp;

    ++endp;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>The fastq format parsing has fairly obvious corner cases since with this
code there can be no text on the &lsquo;comment&rsquo; line and the whole
record must be of four lines.  This version of fastq is the recommended formatting from the
official <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/6/1767.full">fastq publication</a>,
which seems to have been adopted by Illumina and others, so hopefully this simple
parsing will work most of the time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a heap of fun looking at the way this very mature piece of software works
and I&rsquo;ve gotten a usable tool out of it.  Now it&rsquo;s onto the main event of
ripping out parts of the source code that I want for crass</p>
