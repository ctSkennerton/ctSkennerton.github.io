    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered <a href="http://seqan.de">Seqan</a>, a header-only C++ library for
bioinformatics.  I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the toolkit to make some
small programs just to see whether I want to use it in a
larger project.  So far I&rsquo;ve written
<a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/prepmate">prepmate</a>, an adaptor trimming
program for Illumina&rsquo;s Nextera mate-pair libraries; and
<a href="https://github.com/ctSkennerton/fxtract">fxtract</a>, a
grep-like program for extracting fasta/fastq records from large files.  One of the
algorithms that I use in fxtract and in another program I&rsquo;ve written,
<a href="http://ctskennerton.github.io/crass/">crass</a>, is to search for
multiple patterns simultaneously (in this case a number of different DNA
motifs).  Seqan
implements a number of algorithms for multipattern matching (checkout
their tutorial page), however they don&rsquo;t give many clues as to why you
would choose one algorithm over another.  So I decided to take a few of
these implementations out for a spin using fxtract.</p>

<h4>Test variables:</h4>

<ul>
<li>different numbers of patterns: 100, 1000, 10000</li>
<li>different length patterns: uniformly distributed size (0 &ndash; 100bp), 30bp,
60bp</li>
<li>Algorithms: WuManber, MultiBfam, AhoChorasick, SetHorspool</li>
<li>Test dataset: <a href="http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?cmd=viewer&amp;m=data&amp;s=viewer&amp;run=SRR438796">SRR438796</a>,
which is part of an EBPR metagenome that was sequenced with Illumina GAIIx</li>
</ul>


<p>I should point out the the following speed tests are not necessarily
testing the algorithms, but the seqan implementation of these
algorithms in the context of what fxtract is trying to accomplish.  Which
means that other programs which implement these algorithms may perform
quite differently and the conclusions that I reach below may be
different in other situations. So with disclamers out of the way, how
does each implementation perform.</p>

<p>While running through a test of the wumanber implementation I discovered
something very odd when using the uniformly distributed patterns.  With
100 patterns the program ran through fine, outputting the correct
results,
however when using the 1000 or 10000 pattern file I got no output.  I
discovered though that these larger files contained some patterns that
had a length of 0 (i.e. they were empty lines), whereas the 100 pattern file&rsquo;s smallest pattern was
6bp.  I removed the empty lines from my pattern files and then and voila
there was output.  What this means is that <strong>the seqan WuManber
implementation fails silently when given an empty string as one of the
patterns!</strong> I&rsquo;ve submitted a <a href="http://trac.seqan.de/ticket/1117">bug report</a>
 with the seqan authors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/seqan_multipattern_search_speed_benchmark.png", alt="Seqan speed test summary"></p>

<p>The above graph shows the total wall clock time in seconds for each
algorithm to process the input file with the different numbers of search
patterns (columns) or for the different types of patters (rows).<br/>
The main thing that striked me was the poor performance of the<br/>
seqan implementation of the Wu-Manber algorithm &ndash; it does not scale well.</p>

<p>I was lead to believe that Wu-Manber was the pinicle of multipattern
searching so I was a little perplexed by this result.  I know of another
stand alone implementation of Wu-Manber provided by <a href="http://www.oneunified.net/blog/2008/03/23/">Ray
Burkholder</a>.  As a
comparison I tested out this implementation as well and perhaps
unsurprisingly this implementation performed much better (it&rsquo;s referred
to in the figures as &ldquo;non-seqan wu-manber&rdquo;). <strong>Bottom line:
So don&rsquo;t use the Wu-Manber implementation in Seqan!</strong>  The
winner of the speed benchmark was the multiBfam algorithim which
performed nearly identically for any number of input patterns or for the
different length patterns.  In comparison the Aho-Corasick and
SetHorspool algorithms became slower with more patterns.</p>

<p>Speed tells you only half of the story and usually comes at the price of
memory consumption.  Both of the Wu-Manber implementations excelled at
memory consumption, or lack there of.  The worst were the Aho-Corasick
and SetHorspool algorithms, which used 20Gb+ of memory under the worst
case.  The multiBfam algorithm was somewhere in the middle (~7Gb under
the worst case scenario).</p>

<p><img src="/images/seqan_multipattern_search_memory_benchmark.png", alt="Seqan speed test summary"></p>

<p>Considering only the seqan implementations I would probably go for the
multiBfam algorithm as my first choice when searching for less than 1000
patterns after which Wu-Manber would have to be preferred.<br/>
Base on what I&rsquo;ve seen the Aho-Corasick and SetHorspool implementations
in seqan are the worst options as they use far too much memory, however
that&rsquo;s not to say that other implementations of these algorithms would
perform differently.</p>
