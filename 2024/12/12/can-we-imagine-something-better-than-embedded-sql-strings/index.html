    <p>SQL is <em>lingua franca</em> of the data world. Every tool supports it or has some version of it.  I&rsquo;ve been
exposed to Postres, Trino, Spark-SQL, Flink-SQL, MySql, MS-SQL and they all work the same way for basic
things. Of course the real challenge is when things get more complicated, certain functions have
different names, or don&rsquo;t exist, and some query patterns that work well in one engine don&rsquo;t in another.
(And I don&rsquo;t just mean between OLTP and OLAP engines) While these are minor annoyances, it is pretty
amazing to have a declarative language that is mostly familiar across tools and environments so that
everyone from a product manager to a backend engineer can query terabytes of data in a few seconds.</p>
<p>Sadly what isn&rsquo;t amazing is all the extra tooling that has been built on top of this in the data
engineering world.  Data Engineering can&rsquo;t just rely on SQL, we need to orchestrate queries and
parameterize them in various different ways. This is often done in Python (e.g. Airflow, Dagster,
Prefect) using some degree of templating, whether that is using <code>jinja2</code>, <code>f-strings</code>, or <code>.format()</code>.
Doing this has drastic negative effects on developer experience becuase we loose even basic things
like syntax highlighting, or more advanded features of static analysis.</p>
<p>Some IDEs have extensions that detect embedded SQL and apply better linting rules. (Shout out to
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> which does this and lets you select a wide range of SQL
dialects.) But if you don&rsquo;t have that you&rsquo;re stuck looking at a very long string and trying to understand
why, when it&rsquo;s all stitched together, where the syntax error is.</p>
<p>SQL itself is not a language that is easily modularized. It is difficult to create chunks or &ldquo;functions&rdquo;
as part of the query.  I&rsquo;ve seen SQL embedding in python as f-strings where whole parts of the query
are generated by calling functions in the string parameters (those functions themselves taking parameters
from the main python code). It&rsquo;s impossible to read but it&rsquo;s done because the original author was
struggling to make something that was composible.</p>
<p>There are other APIs, <abbr title="Object Relational Mapping">ORMs</abbr> wrap up SQL in more native
looking code and some tools like <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Spark</a> have a data frame API which provides
python native access. I&rsquo;ve found getting out of SQL and using the data frame API quite a productivity
boost but&hellip;</p>
<p>Because SQL is <em>lingua franca</em> it is difficult to on board users onto other ways of developing. Any
open source Data or BI tool will accept SQL but ORM wrappers or data frame APIs aren&rsquo;t supported.  I
try to work as much in Spark as possible and use the Dataframe API as much as I can due to it&rsquo;s
composibility, but it is hard to iterate quickly when Trino is just faster at some things and the only
way to use it is via SQL through the company sanctioned web app BI tool.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe this doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore: I can ask github copilot to take some SQL and convert
it into pyspark Dataframe API, and it does a pretty good job of it</p>
